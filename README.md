Peregrine is a real-time hypervisor with a strong security focus, initially supporting aarch64 (64-bit Armv8 CPUs).

## Building Peregrine
This repository only contains the actual hypervisor code. For evaluation, please consider the [build repository](https://github.com/SANCTUARY-Systems/Peregrine).

The [build repository](https://github.com/SANCTUARY-Systems/Peregrine) builds the Peregrine Hypervisor, as well as all other system components (Arm Trusted Firmware A, u-boot) and a Linux VM to execute. The resulting software package can be executed on the Arm Fixed Virtual Platform simulator, which will be downloaded automatically.
